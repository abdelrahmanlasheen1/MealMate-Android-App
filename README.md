## About the App
MealMate allows users to:

- Discover a wide variety of recipes
- Save favorite recipes for easy access
- Geotag grocery stores or locations
- Access recipes offline

I built this app for Android using Kotlin, Room Database, Firebase, and TheMealDB API. The design is responsive, intuitive, and user-friendly.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Kotlin  
- **Database:** Room (local) & Firebase Realtime Database (cloud)  
- **Media Storage:** Firebase Cloud Storage  
- **Architecture:** MVC pattern  
- **APIs:** TheMealDB API  
- **UI Design:** Material Design Principles

## Architecture
I organized the app using the MVC pattern for clarity and maintainability:

- **Packages:** Separate packages for models, views, repositories, and database management  
- **Adapters & Fragments:** HorizontalRecipeAdapter, RecipeAdapter, HomeFragment, FavouritesFragment, ProfileFragment, SearchFragment  
- **Activities:** LoginActivity, SignUpActivity, AddRecipeActivity, AllRecipesActivity, DetailActivity, MapActivity, SettingActivity, SplashActivity  

This structure ensures modular, testable, and maintainable code.

## Storage & APIs
- **Room Database:** Stores favorite recipes for offline access  
- **Firebase Realtime Database:** Stores structured recipe data  
- **Firebase Cloud Storage:** Stores images and media  
- **TheMealDB API:** Fetches recipes, ingredients, and meal categories

## Testing
I implemented both unit and UI tests:

| Test Case                 | Expected Result                           | Status  |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------|
| Insert Recipe              | Recipe added to the database              | Passed  |
| Delete Recipe              | Recipe removed from database              | Passed  |
| Get All Favorite Recipes   | Retrieves all saved recipes correctly     | Passed  |
| Search Recipe              | Recipes correctly filtered                | Passed  |
| Favorite Recipe UI Update  | UI updates to reflect favorited recipes   | Passed  |

## Future Improvements
